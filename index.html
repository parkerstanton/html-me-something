        <h1>Parker's Favorite Lifts</h1>
                <h2>Bench Press</h2>
                <h4>Intro</h4>
                <p> The bench press is the first major lift I ever learned how to do and it quickly became my favorite. It's a lift that most non-lifters are pretty familiar with but not everyone knows how to properly execute. Improper form and/or technique can overstress the shoulder and deltoids and lead to strain or even moderate to severe shoulder issues. </p>

                <h2>Deadlift</h2>
                <h4>Intro</h4>
                <p>The deadlift started out as my least favorite lift ever but has slowly grown to become my second favorite! Although it is the simplest lift on this list it is repeatedely referred to as the "king of lifts" because of just how much of your body is required to do it properly. It recruits your legs, back, chest and shoulders through the entire lift and also really builds up hand strength.</p>

                <h2>Squat</h2>
                <h4>Intro</h4>
                <p>The squat. What used to be my favorite lift has now fallen down to third place. While I appreciate and respect leg day I no longer look forward to it and am almost to the point where I dread it every week. Proper form and a spotter are a must on this lift as it has the potential to really mess you up. Countless lifters have suffered lower back and/or knee pain from incorrect posture and form. </p>
